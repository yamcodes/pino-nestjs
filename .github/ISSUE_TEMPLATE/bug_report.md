- [ ] I've read [the docs of pino-nestjs](https://github.com/yamcodes/pino-nestjs/blob/master/README.md)
- [ ] I've read [the docs of pino](https://getpino.io/#/) and [pino-http](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-http)
- [ ] I couldn't find the same [open issue of pino-nestjs](https://github.com/yamcodes/pino-nestjs/issues)
- [ ] This bug is related only to current library or I've tested the same behaviour with the built-in logger and this is not a bug of NestJS.

**What is the current behavior?**

**What is the expected behavior?**

**Please provide minimal example repo, not code snippet. Without example repo this issue will be closed.**
